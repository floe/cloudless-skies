# Cloudless Skies? Decentralizing Mobile Interaction

## Workshop at MobileHCI 2020, October 5th, Oldenburg, Germany

Mobile interaction is now almost exclusively dependent on an intransparent cloud infrastructure beyond the users' control, resulting in multiple issues related to security, privacy, and availability. While alternative approaches based on decentralized network architectures exist, these have their own set of issues such as lack of usability or content moderation.

In this workshop, we bring together researchers from related, but rarely interconnected fields to discuss issues and opportunities related to decentralization.  We will develop and discuss current and future scenarios for decentralized mobile interaction, both utopian and dystopian. We invite researchers interested in implementation and networking aspects of mobile decentralization as well as those focusing on ethical, legal and social implications (ELSI) of these alternative approaches to the mobile ecosystem.
